<p>7)	The admin can approve or decline the vets from entering the system and can see the list of all vets and pet owners, existing in the system.</p>


## ▪️Build/Deployment instructions <a name = "build_instructions"></a>
We have deployed our application on the Virtual Machine provided. For backend we are using docker & for frontend we are using nginx as deployment servers.

Before script:

To connect to the VM using SSH, gitlab-runner needs to be installed with openssh-client & the private key stored in gitlab variables should be given read, write accesses.

### Frontend Deployment steps:

1. Our project structure has frontend and backend folders at root, so first we cd into frontend

2. Then we run npm install to download all dependencies from package.json

3. Then we run npm run build which in turn runs webpack --mode production --env env=production command, webpack bundles all the files as per webpack.config.js

4. Webpack bundles these files in dist folder along with all the assets, bundle.js & index.html

5. Then the process copies the file from gitlab-runner terminal to remote terminal in VM using SSH

6. The files in dist are copied to /var/www/html folder where nginx is serving the index.html indefinitely (so it starts serving the new index.html)

### Backend Deployment steps:

1. cd into backend

2. run mvn package command to generate the war file in target folder

3. connect to the remote VM using SSH

4. stop the docker container named as pawpals (if running)

5. remove the docker container named as pawpals

6. copy the war file over network to the remote VM in the Pawpals folder of the user

7. build the docker container using the “docker build -t pawpals:latest -f dockerfile .”

8. Once the docker container is built successfully, run it on port 8080

docker run -d --name pawpals -p 8080:8080 pawpals

### Run Locally
<b>Install the following -</b> 
- Java 17
-  mySql 
- Maven
- Npm (Package manager)
- Node.js

<b>After installing the above, </b>
- Clone the repository: Start by cloning the repository containing the React application to your local machine. 

#### <b>Frontend</b>
 ##### <b>STEP 1: </b>
Install dependencies: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using the "NPM" package manager. Run the following command in your terminal:

 - cd <b>Project_Directory/frontend</b>
- npm install 

 ##### <b>STEP 2:</b> 
Start the development server: Once all the dependencies are installed, start the development server using the package manager by running the following command:

 - npm start

 ##### <b>STEP 3: </b>
View the application: Open a web browser and navigate to the URL where the application is running, such as http://localhost:3001/. You should see the React application running in your web browser.

#### <b>Backend</b>
 ##### <b>STEP 1: </b>
Install dependencies: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using the maven package manager. Run the following command in your terminal:

 - cd <b>Project_Directory/backend</b>
- mvn install

 ##### <b>STEP 2:</b> 
Run the application: Once the dependencies are installed successfully, you can start the Spring Boot application using the command line. Run the following command in your terminal:

- mvn spring-boot:run

This will start the Spring Boot application, and you should see a message in your terminal that the application is running on a specific port, such as http://localhost:8080/.

 ##### <b>STEP 3: </b>
Test the application: Open a web browser and navigate to the URL where the application is running, such as http://localhost:8080/. You should see the Spring Boot application running in your web browser.


# ☑️ CI/CD <a name = "ci/cd"></a>


## ▪️Build <a name = "build"></a>

In our project, we have also implemented a similar approach for the build stage of our CI Pipeline. We have two distinct jobs: the frontend build job and the backend build job.

![Build](./readme/images/cicd/build.png)

## ▪️Test <a name = "test1"></a>

we are using JUnit, a popular open-source testing framework for Java, to test our application. We have integrated JUnit tests into our CI pipeline by running the "mvn test" command, which invokes the Maven build tool to execute the tests.

![Test](./readme/images/cicd/test.png)



## ▪️Code Quality <a name = "code_quality"></a>

The Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline of the application includes a stage for code quality assurance, which covers both the frontend and backend code. 
- Job1: The frontend code quality is ensured by integrating prettier into the pipeline, which checks for proper formatting of the codebase. 
- Job2: The backend code quality is evaluated by running designated code smell tools, which generate reports of potential issues in the code. These code smell reports are then saved in artifacts, which can be downloaded later to analyze the code in detail.

## ▪️Design principles <a name = "design_principles"></a>


<h4> Single Responsibility Principle </h4>

<p> The Single Responsibility Principle dictates that a class should have a singular responsibility, promoting the separation of concerns and facilitating the modification, testing, and reuse of code. This principle is being adhered to in several instances where we are creating distinct controllers and services for various stakeholders. </p>

![Image](./readme/images/principles/img1.png)

<p>Figure 1: depicting we have different controller and services for different stakeholders</p>

![Image](./readme/images/principles/img2.png)

<p>Figure 2: This is the pet controller which have pet owner related methods</p>

<h4>Open/Closed Principle (OCP) </h4>

<p>"A class should be open for extension but closed for modification" means that a class's behavior can be extended without modifying its source code. We have implemented this principle in our application by creating separate classes for different types of users, such as VetDto and PetOwnerDto, which extend the parent UserDto class. This allows us to add new attributes specific to each type of user without modifying the UserDto class directly.</p>

![Image](./readme/images/principles/img3.png)

<p>Figure 3: UserDto class [parent class which is open of extension and close for modification]</p>

<p> Figure 4: VetDto which is child class of userdto</p>

![Image](./readme/images/principles/img5.png)

<p> Figure 5: PetOwnerDto which is child class of userdto </p>

<h4>Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)</h4>

<p>Subtypes should be able to replace their base types without changing the correctness of the program. As a result, we ensure that if any class implements an abstract class or interface, it can fully replace its parent class.</p>

<h4>Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)</h4>

<p>The Interface Segregation Principle advocates for the use of smaller, more specialized interfaces instead of larger, more complex ones. This approach enables easier maintenance, testing, and code reuse. To implement this principle, we have designed separate interfaces for specific tasks. For example, we have a dedicated mail service interface responsible solely for sending mails, without including unnecessary methods that users would have to implement during implementation. By segregating interfaces in this way, we ensure that our application remains organized and manageable.</p>

![Image](./readme/images/principles/img6.png)

<p>Figure 6: MailService interface which is responsible for mail related task</p>

![Image](./readme/images/principles/img7.png)

<p>Figure 7: class implementing mail service</p>

<h4>Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)</h4>

<p>To promote modularity and extensibility, the principle suggests that modules should rely on abstractions such as interfaces and abstract classes. To reduce dependencies on individual classes and decouple the components, we employ numerous interfaces and classes. As we're using Spring Boot for our application, we don't need to be too concerned about this principle because the framework is based on SOLID principle.</p>


## ▪️Architecture smells <a name = "architecture_smell"></a>

### 1. Vet Flow
- Package - (VetController.java) com.asdc.pawpals.controller; (VetServiceImpl.java) com.asdc.pawpals.service
- Status - Resolved
- Comments - Initially, this package had two distinct responsibilities, namely managing the vet and handling the appointments made by pet owners to meet with the vet. However, this led to a concentration of features within the package, resulting in a code smell known as Feature Concentration. To address this issue, the package was refactored by splitting the vet flow, including the controller, service, and repository, into two separate flows: appointment and vet. This separation effectively resolved the Feature Concentration smell, allowing for a more modular and maintainable codebase.

### 2. com.asdc.pawpals.model
- Package - (VetController.java) com.asdc.pawpals.controller; (VetServiceImpl.java) com.asdc.pawpals.service
- Package - com.asdc.pawpals.model
- Status - not resolved
- Comments - In Java Spring Boot applications, there are certain code smells that may arise, one of which is feature concentration. This is characterized by the presence of all the models of a class within the models package. However, it should be noted that this code smell cannot be resolved, as it is inherent in the way Spring Boot applications are structured. The layer-wise structure of the project, which is widely recognized and followed in the industry, includes the separation of concerns and the organization of related functionalities into packages. In particular, the models package typically contains all the entity classes that represent the domain objects of the application. This concentration of related features within a single package enhances the maintainability and readability of the codebase, making it easier for developers to navigate and understand the project. Thus, while feature concentration may initially be perceived as a code smell, it is actually a deliberate and beneficial design choice in the context of Java Spring Boot applications.

## ▪️Design smells <a name = "design_smell"></a>

### 1. TestModelTest 
- Package - com.asdc.pawpals.model
- Class - TestModelTest
- Status - Resolved
- Comments - This class was not used in the implementation and hence was deleted from the project.

### 2. TestUtils
- Package - com.asdc.pawpals.utils
- Class - TestUtils
- Status - Resolved
- Comments - This class was not used in the implementation and hence was deleted from the project.

### 3. PetOwner 
- Package - com.asdc.pawpals.model
- Class - PetOwner
- Status - Not resolved
- Comments - The classes have getters/ setters implemented through lombok. The classes have hidden getters and setters set through Lombok, using the @getter @setter anotation. These are JPA related cyclic dependencies, can not change the relationships

## ▪️Implementation smells <a name = "implementation_smell"></a>

### 1. isValidAppointment
- Package - com.asdc.pawpals.validators
- Class - AppointmentValidators
- Method -  isValidAppointment
- Status - Done
- Comments - By incorporating variables with clear and descriptive names, we were able to enhance the readability of the code that previously contained a lengthy return statement. Previously, the return statement had multiple function calls and logical operators, making it challenging to comprehend the code's intended purpose. However, by storing the function results in these variables, we were able to simplify the code and make it more straightforward. As a result, the newly modified code is now more intuitive and easier to understand.

![Image](./readme/images/smells/implementationSmells/1-is-valid-appointment-appointment.png)

### 2. addCorsMappings
- Package - com.asdc.pawpals.config
- Class - CorsConfiguration
- Method -  addCorsMappings
- Status- Partially resolve (½)
- Comments - The long statement in the addCorsMappings method may be difficult to remove without affecting the readability or the functionality of the code. The method is using method chaining to configure the CORS settings in a concise and efficient way. If you try to break the method calls into separate lines, you will end up with a longer and less readable code. Similarly, splitting the method into smaller methods might not be effective as it may not add any clarity to the code, and may even make it more complicated. This also had a magic no smell which was resolved by adding the value to a constant.

![Image](./readme/images/smells/implementationSmells/2-add-cors-mapping.png)


### 3. getAvailablity
- Package - com.asdc.pawpals.controller
- Class - VetController
- Method - getAvailablity
- Status- Resolved
- Comments - To simplify a complex conditional statement that contained multiple function calls within an if() condition, the following refactoring approach was taken.

- The statement was decomposed into smaller parts by extracting the values from the function calls and storing them in separate variables. Then, the results of the function calls were stored in a boolean variable that was used in the if() condition statement. This approach helped to reduce the complexity of the original conditional statement and make it easier to understand.
